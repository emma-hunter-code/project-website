            Becoming a developer was not something I imagined for myself. While
            I am fairly tech-savvy, I assumed I did not have the correct
            skills-but then a colleague suggested it could be suited to me,
            after we collaborated on an IT project. That sparked my
            curiosity—and I came to realise it was something I loved as I like
            to design, build and solve problems.
            <br />

            I am currently learning to code with
            <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/">SheCodes</a>, focusing on HTML,
            CSS, and Bootstrap using VS Code. I manage my code via my
            <a href="https://github.com/emma-hunter-code">GitHub account</a> and
            host SEO-friendly sites on Netlify. I have leant how to build
            applications using JavaScript, Python, APIs, and AI tools. My

            reflects what I have learned so far—along with plenty I am still
            discovering!
            <br />
            <br />
            I do not have a defined long-term plan just yet, but I really enjoy
            learning and creating. I can happily tinker for hours.

          <h3>Work</h3>
          <div class="about-paragraph">
            Since 2009, I have worked in medical research operations, mostly
            within universities. My role has involved developing processes from
            the ground up—right through to implementation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Throughout my career, I have used code in small ways. I work with
            research data using SPSS and R, and I am now excited to apply Python
            to similar tasks. I have a professional certificate in Data Analysis
            from
            <a
              href="https://www.bcs.org/qualifications-and-certifications/certifications-for-professionals/business-analysis/professional-certificate-in-data-analysis/"
              >BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT</a
            >, where I learned how to structure data for business systems
            including requirements gathering, class diagrams and normalisation.
            <br />
            <br />
            One of my most rewarding projects involved designing and
            implementing a system to manage complex research proposals across
            multiple teams using
            <a href="https://project-redcap.org/">REDCap</a>. That is where my
            interest in coding really began—even if I did not realise it at the
            time.

          <div class="about-paragraph">
            I am not a professional designer, but I understand the fundamentals
            of good design and appreciate things that look clean and
            well-crafted, favouring function over form whilst looking great. I
            have a degree in Graphic Design at the
            <a href="https://www.uca.ac.uk/">University for the Creative Arts</a
            >, which I completed in 2009 (yikes—but still relevant!).

            I am originally from the UK and currently living in Bristol,
            Southwest England, with my husband and our two cats. In 2023, I was
            diagnosed with ADHD and a long-term health condition—both of which
            have shaped how I work and learn. When I am not coding, I enjoy time
            with my cats, eating out, nail art, shopping, wine, gardening,
            aromatherapy, and walking.
